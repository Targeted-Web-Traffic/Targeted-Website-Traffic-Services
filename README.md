---

## How We Work (Our Process)

1. **Discovery (15–30 minutes).** We review your goals (leads, sales, trials), audience, and markets.
2. **Plan.** We tailor SEO and traffic mix: local/international SEO + one primary traffic lane (organic-style ads, mobile, social, or referral).
3. **Build.** Implement on-page fixes, tracking, and landing-page improvements.
4. **Launch.** Start traffic with conservative daily caps; monitor early signals (load, bounce, scroll, opt-ins).
5. **Optimize Weekly.** Adjust targeting, creatives, and page elements; send summaries with clear next steps.
6. **Scale (Optional).** Increase caps or expand markets once conversion metrics justify it.

---

## Local SEO (U.S. Cities, States, and Service Areas)

Local SEO is about **owning your neighborhood** in Google and Maps:

* **Google Business Profile (GBP):** We optimize name, categories, services, business description, hours, photos, Q&A, and weekly posts.
* **NAP Consistency:** Name, address, phone, and website alignment across directories (Yelp, Apple Maps, BBB, industry citations).
* **Local Pages:** Create or refine service-area pages (e.g., *Kitchen Remodeling in Brookfield, WI*). Each page gets unique copy, FAQs, and proof.
* **Reviews & Reputation:** Ethical review requests (no incentives). We help with wording, pacing, and responses.
* **On-Page SEO:** Schema (LocalBusiness, FAQ), internal links, speed, and mobile usability.

**What success looks like:** More map views, calls, direction requests, and quote forms from your service area—*not* just generic impressions.

---

## International SEO (Going Global, Safely)

Selling beyond the U.S.? We help you expand without cannibalizing your core site.

* **Market Prioritization:** Start with Tier-1 (US/CA/UK/AU) or high-potential regions based on demand and margins.
* **Structure:** Country-specific subfolders (e.g., `/uk/`, `/ca/`) with localized content and currency.
* **Hreflang:** Proper tags to route users to the right language/region.
* **Local Search Intent:** Keyword research by region (yes, phrasing and competitors change).
* **Compliance & Trust:** Clear shipping, taxes, and regional policies to reduce friction.

**Goal:** Build durable rankings and conversion pathways in each target market while protecting site health.

---

## SEO Content Writing (Pages That Rank *and* Convert)

Our approach blends **search intent** and **sales intent**:

* **Keyword → Outline → Draft → Review** (with your voice and brand).
* **Search intent mapping:** Informational guides for discovery; comparison and pricing content for high intent.
* **Conversion copy:** Strong hooks, benefits, objections handled, and trust signals baked in.
* **Formatting:** Readable H2/H3s, short paragraphs, bullets, and visuals.
* **Refresh cadence:** Light updates quarterly to keep pages fresh and compounding.

**Deliverables:** Topic map, page briefs, drafts, metadata, internal link plan, and optional schema.

---

## Web Design & Redesign (Modern, Fast, SEO-Friendly)

Design should **look great** and **sell well**:

* **Platforms:** We work with many, but **WordPress** is our default for SEO flexibility.
* **Performance:** Sub-3s mobile load, optimized images, clean theme, minimal plugins.
* **Clarity:** A single primary CTA per page section.
* **Trust:** Proof modules—badges, trackers (blurred), concise case bullets, FAQs, and guarantee/disclaimer.
* **Accessibility & UX:** Legible fonts, contrast, keyboard nav, and simple forms.

**Outcome:** A site that’s easy to trust and easy to buy from.

### Targeted Website Traffic (Any Country, Any State)

* **Delivery & Caps:** Smooth daily pacing to protect quality and analytics integrity.
* **Best For:** Local services, new product launches, and regional expansions.

**What you get:** Setup, targeting, tracker link(s), weekly summary, and recommendations.

---

### Targeted **Organic Traffic (Ads)** — Choose 3 Relevant Keywords

This is our **organic-style ad traffic**: placements and audiences aligned to **search-like intent** so visitors behave more like natural searchers.

* **Pick 3 starter keywords** that match your **offer + intent**. Examples:

  * *“affordable website traffic”* (commercial)
  * *“geo-targeted traffic”* (commercial)
  * *“increase website visitors fast”* (problem→solution)
* **Why 3?** It keeps the test clean. We can expand once the winners emerge.
* **Optimization:** We adjust angles and audiences based on on-site engagement and conversions.

**Best For:** Sites with clear offers, working landing pages, and an active follow-up process.

> **Note:** “Organic traffic (ads)” refers to **ad-driven visitors with organic-style behavior**, not free search traffic. We use ad placements that simulate real browsing patterns (brand-safe), and you track results normally.

---

### Mobile Traffic

* **Focus:** Smartphone users (optionally tablets).
* **Use Cases:** App installs, mobile-first e-commerce, SMS capture, and on-the-go local searches.
* **What changes:** Creative sizes, load speed, and shorter forms.
* **Why it works:** Mobile often converts quickly—if the landing experience is clean and fast.

---

### Social Media Traffic

* **Audience:** People already engaged with topics near your category.
* **Angles:** Educational hooks, short video clips, and credibility snippets.
* **Routing:** Direct to landing pages or content pieces with a clear next step.
* **Best For:** Content-led funnels, education, memberships, and events.

---

### Referral Traffic

* **What it is:** Clicks from curated, brand-safe publishers (articles, resource pages, and features), not bot farms or low-quality click exchanges.
* **Why it helps:** Warmer context and higher time-on-page when the placement matches the offer.
* **Best For:** Thought leadership pieces, case studies, and niche products.

---

### Email Marketing

* **What we do:** Campaign planning, compliant lists, segmentation, creative, and testing (available to limited clients).

**Q1: How fast will I see traffic?**
